- **Cities**: Cities within each region
- **Districts**: Districts within major cities
- **Special**: Remote, GCC countries

**Structure**:
```json
{
  "regions": [
    {
      "id": "riyadh",
      "name": "Riyadh",
      "cities": [
        {
          "id": "riyadh-city",
          "name": "Riyadh City",
          "districts": ["Al Olaya", "Al Malaz", ...]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Wizard Navigation

  locationRegion: "Riyadh",
  locationCity: "Riyadh City",
  locationDistrict: "Al Olaya"
}
```

## Payment Step

## Form Service Updates

### Lookup Integration

  label: 'Task Type',
  type: 'select',
  lookupKey: 'taskTypes'  // Uses data/lookups.json
}
```

### Tailwind CSS Classes
All form fields now use Tailwind utility classes:
- `w-full px-4 py-2 border border-gray-300 rounded-md`
