# Opportunity Creation

## Overview

The Opportunity Creation module is the core workflow of the PMTwin platform. It enables authenticated users (companies and professionals) to create collaboration opportunities through a 6-step wizard. The module supports 5 collaboration models with 13 sub-models, each defining a unique set of questions and fields. It also integrates 5 exchange modes for flexible financial arrangements and a hierarchical location system. Upon publication, the system triggers the matching algorithm to find suitable candidates.

## Actors

| Actor  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| User   | An authenticated company account or individual professional/consultant who creates the opportunity. |
| System | Manages the wizard flow, validates inputs, persists data, triggers matching, and creates audit logs. |

---

## Step-by-Step Flow

The opportunity creation wizard consists of 6 sequential steps. The user can navigate forward (with validation) and backward freely.

### Step 1 -- Basic Information

**Primary Question**
"What is this opportunity about and where is it located?"

**Why This Question Exists**
Every opportunity needs a title and location for identification, search, and geographic matching. The description provides context for potential applicants.

**User Inputs**

| Field       | Type     | Required | Constraints               |
|-------------|----------|----------|---------------------------|
| title       | text     | Yes      | maxLength: 150            |
| description | textarea | No       | maxLength: 2000           |
| location    | composite| Yes      | Hierarchical selection    |

Location is a 4-level hierarchical selection:

| Level    | Type   | Required | Source                              |
|----------|--------|----------|-------------------------------------|
| Country  | select | Yes      | `locations.json > countries`        |
| Region   | select | No       | Cascading based on country          |
| City     | select | No       | Cascading based on region           |
| District | select | No       | Cascading based on city             |

**Dropdown Values -- Countries**
- Saudi Arabia (with 13 regions, each with cities and districts)
- UAE
- Qatar
- Kuwait
- Bahrain
- Oman
- Remote

**Conditional Logic**
- Region populates when a country is selected.
- City populates when a region is selected.
- District populates when a city is selected.

**Validation Rules**
- `title` -- Required.
- Location (at least country) -- Required.

**System Actions**
- Store values in wizard state.
- Navigate to Step 2.

### Step 2 -- Intent Label

**Primary Question**
"Are you requesting something or offering something?"

**Why This Question Exists**
The intent label (REQUEST vs OFFER) fundamentally changes how the opportunity is interpreted by other users and the matching algorithm. A REQUEST seeks collaborators to fulfill a need; an OFFER provides capabilities seeking a match.

**User Inputs**

| Field  | Type  | Required | Values                    |
|--------|-------|----------|---------------------------|
| intent | radio | Yes      | `request` (REQUEST), `offer` (OFFER) |

**Dropdown Values**
N/A -- radio buttons. Values from `lookups.json > intentLabels`:
- `{ id: "request", label: "REQUEST" }`
- `{ id: "offer", label: "OFFER" }`

**Conditional Logic**
- Intent cannot be changed after the opportunity is created.

**Validation Rules**
- One option must be selected.

**System Actions**
- Store intent in wizard state.
- Navigate to Step 3.

---

### Step 3 -- Scope and Capabilities

**Primary Question**
"What skills, sectors, and certifications are relevant to this opportunity?"

**Why This Question Exists**
Scope data (skills, sectors, interests, certifications) is the primary input for the matching algorithm. It determines which users are shown as potential matches.

**User Inputs**

| Field          | Type | Required | Notes                          |
|----------------|------|----------|--------------------------------|
| requiredSkills | tags | Yes      | Comma-separated tag input      |
| sectors        | tags | No       | Comma-separated tag input      |
| interests      | tags | No       | Comma-separated tag input      |
| certifications | tags | No       | Comma-separated tag input      |

**Dropdown Values**
N/A -- free-form tag inputs.

**Conditional Logic**
None.

**Validation Rules**
- `requiredSkills` -- Required. At least one skill must be entered.

**System Actions**
- Store scope data in wizard state.
- Navigate to Step 4.

### Step 4 -- Category and Sub-Model Selection

**Primary Question**
"What type of collaboration are you looking for?"

**Why This Question Exists**
The collaboration model and sub-model determine the entire set of model-specific questions. Each sub-model represents a distinct business arrangement with its own attributes, validation rules, and conditional fields.

**User Inputs**

| Field     | Type  | Required | Source                                 |
|-----------|-------|----------|----------------------------------------|
| category  | radio | Yes      | 5 parent models (see below)            |
| subModel  | radio | Yes      | Sub-models for the selected category   |

Plus: all model-specific attribute fields (see detailed sub-model sections below).

**Category (Parent Model) Selection**

| Key                    | Label                      |
|------------------------|----------------------------|
| `project_based`        | Project-Based Collaboration|
| `strategic_partnership` | Strategic Partnerships     |
| `resource_pooling`     | Resource Pooling & Sharing |
| `hiring`               | Hiring a Resource          |
| `competition`          | Call for Competition       |

**Conditional Logic**
- Selecting a category shows its available sub-models.
- Selecting a sub-model dynamically loads and renders all attribute fields for that sub-model.
- Within sub-models, individual fields may have conditional visibility rules (documented per sub-model below).

**Validation Rules**
- Category selection -- Required.
- Sub-model selection -- Required.
- All required attributes for the selected sub-model must be filled.

**System Actions**
- Store `modelType` and `subModelType` in wizard state.
- Render dynamic form based on the selected sub-model's attribute definitions.
- Navigate to Step 5.

### Step 5 -- Exchange Mode and Financial Terms

**Primary Question**
"What are the financial terms for this opportunity?"

**Why This Question Exists**
PMTwin supports multiple value exchange mechanisms beyond traditional cash payments. This step captures the budget range, selected exchange mode, and mode-specific financial details.

**User Inputs -- Common Fields**

| Field              | Type           | Required | Notes                        |

#### Exchange Mode: Cash

#### Exchange Mode: Hybrid

|--------------------|---------|----------|------------------------------------|

**Validation**: `hybridCash + hybridEquity + hybridBarter` must equal 100%. At least one component must be specified.

---

**Conditional Logic**
- Mode-specific fields appear/disappear based on `exchangeMode` selection.
- Currency field is shown only for Cash and Hybrid modes.
- Budget range is always shown regardless of mode.

**Validation Rules**
- Budget range (min and max) -- Required.
- Exchange mode -- Required.
- Exchange agreement checkbox -- Required.
- Mode-specific required fields (see tables above).
- Hybrid mode: percentages must sum to 100%.

**System Actions**
- Store exchange data in wizard state under `exchangeData`.
- Navigate to Step 6.

---

### Step 6 -- Review and Publish

**Primary Question**
"Review your opportunity and choose whether to save as draft or publish."

**Why This Question Exists**
The review step gives the creator a final chance to verify all entered data. The status selection allows saving incomplete work as a draft or publishing immediately.

**User Inputs**

| Field  | Type   | Required | Options                  |
|--------|--------|----------|--------------------------|
| status | select | Yes      | `draft`, `published`     |

**Conditional Logic**
- `draft` -- Opportunity is saved but not visible to other users. Matching is not triggered.
- `published` -- Opportunity is visible to all users. Matching algorithm runs automatically.

**Validation Rules**
- Status must be selected.

**System Actions**
1. Assemble the complete opportunity object from all wizard steps.
2. Persist the opportunity via `dataService.createOpportunity()`.
3. Create audit log entry:
   - `action`: `opportunity_created`
   - `entityType`: `opportunity`
4. If status is `published`:
   - Trigger matching algorithm (`matchingService.findMatchesForOpportunity()`).
   - Auto-notify candidates with match score >= 80%.
5. Redirect to the opportunity detail page.
