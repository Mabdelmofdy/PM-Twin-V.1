# Application

## Overview

The Application module enables authenticated users to apply for published opportunities and allows opportunity owners to review, manage, and act on received applications. The module implements a 6-step application wizard with conditional steps, a matching algorithm that scores candidate-opportunity compatibility, and a pipeline/kanban view for application management. Accepting an application triggers automatic contract creation (documented in the Contract and Execution module).

## Actors

| Actor             | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| Applicant         | An authenticated user (company or individual) who submits an application for an opportunity they did not create. |
| Opportunity Owner | The user who created the opportunity. Reviews applications and can accept, reject, or shortlist them. |
| System            | Manages application creation, status transitions, matching, notifications, and automatic contract creation on acceptance. |

---

## Build proposal workflow

To build and submit a proposal (application), the user opens an opportunity (e.g. from the Opportunities list), then clicks **Apply** (or "Apply Now" on the opportunity detail page). This starts the application wizard. The user completes: **Proposal** (Step 2, required), optional **Requirements** (Step 3) if the opportunity has model-specific attributes, **Payment** preference (Step 4), optional **Bidding** (Step 5) for task-based opportunities, and **Review** (Step 6), then submits. The owner can then review, shortlist, accept, or reject the application. Accepting an application creates a contract (see Contract and Execution module).

---

## Step-by-Step Flow

### Pre-Conditions

- The opportunity must have status `published` or `in_negotiation`.
- The applicant must be authenticated.
- The applicant must not be the opportunity creator.
- If the applicant has already applied, the wizard opens in edit mode.

---

### Step 1 -- Overview (Read-Only)

**Primary Question**
N/A -- this step displays the opportunity summary for the applicant's review before they begin their application.

**Why This Question Exists**
The applicant needs to review the full opportunity details (title, intent, model type, status, creator, location, exchange mode, description, model-specific details) before committing to an application.

**User Inputs**
None. This is a read-only summary.

**Displayed Information**
- Opportunity title
- Intent label (REQUEST or OFFER)
- Model type and sub-model
- Status
- Creation date
- Creator name/email
- Location
- Exchange mode
- Description
- Model-specific attribute details
- Exchange data (budget range, payment terms, etc.)

**Conditional Logic**
- If the user has already applied, an "Already Applied" section is shown with applied date and current status, plus an "Edit Application" button.
- If the user has not applied, an "Apply Now" button is shown.

**Validation Rules**
None.

**System Actions**
- Load opportunity data and creator information.
- Check if applicant has an existing application for this opportunity.
- Determine which wizard steps are needed (Steps 3 and 5 are conditional).
- Setup wizard navigation.

---

### Step 2 -- Proposal

**Primary Question**
"Describe your proposal for this opportunity."

**Why This Question Exists**
The proposal is the core of every application. It is the primary text the opportunity owner reads to evaluate the applicant's fit, approach, and qualifications.

**User Inputs**

| Field                | Type     | Required | Notes                              |
|----------------------|----------|----------|------------------------------------|
| application-proposal | textarea | Yes      | Free-form proposal text            |

**Dropdown Values**
None.

**Conditional Logic**
None -- this step is always shown.

**Validation Rules**
- `application-proposal` -- Required. Cannot be empty (after trim). Error: "Please provide a proposal".

**System Actions**
- Store proposal text in application state.
- Navigate to Step 3 (if detailed responses are needed) or Step 4.

---

### Step 3 -- Detailed Responses (Conditional)

**Primary Question**
"Provide detailed responses to each requirement of this opportunity."

**Why This Question Exists**
For opportunities that have model-specific attributes, the applicant should address each requirement individually. This step dynamically generates a response field for every relevant attribute defined in the opportunity's sub-model.

**User Inputs**

For each model-specific attribute (excluding system fields like title, description, status, location, exchangeMode, exchangeData):

| Field                     | Type     | Required | Notes                              |
|---------------------------|----------|----------|------------------------------------|
| response-{attributeKey}   | textarea | No       | Response to a specific requirement |

Each response field displays:
- The attribute label
- The requirement value from the opportunity
- A textarea for the applicant's response

**Dropdown Values**
None.

**Conditional Logic**
- This entire step is **skipped** if the opportunity's sub-model has no relevant attributes (after filtering out system fields).
- When skipped, the wizard advances directly from Step 2 to Step 4.
- The step indicator for Step 3 is hidden when the step is skipped.

**Validation Rules**
- No mandatory validation on individual response fields (responses are optional per field).

**System Actions**
- Generate dynamic form fields based on the opportunity's model definition.
- Store responses keyed as `response_{attributeKey}`.
- Navigate to Step 4.

---

### Step 4 -- Payment Preference

**Primary Question**
"What is your preference regarding the payment/exchange terms?"

**Why This Question Exists**
The opportunity specifies exchange terms (exchange mode and amounts). The applicant needs to indicate whether they accept the terms as stated, prefer to discuss modifications, or have custom terms.

**User Inputs**

| Field                          | Type   | Required | Options                               |
|--------------------------------|--------|----------|---------------------------------------|
| application-payment-preference | select | Yes      | `accept` (Accept as stated), `discuss` (Prefer to discuss), `custom` |
| application-payment-comments   | textarea | No    | Additional comments about payment     |

**Displayed Information**
- The opportunity's exchange mode label (e.g., "Cash Payment", "Equity", "Profit Sharing", "Barter Exchange", "Hybrid").

**Dropdown Values**
Payment preference options are static:
- `accept` -- "Accept as stated"
- `discuss` -- "Prefer to discuss"
- `custom` -- Custom terms

**Conditional Logic**
None -- this step is always shown.

**Validation Rules**
- `application-payment-preference` -- Required. Error: "Please select your payment preference".

**System Actions**
- Store payment preference and comments in application responses.
- Navigate to Step 5 (if task bidding is needed) or Step 6.

---

### Step 5 -- Task Bidding (Conditional)

**Primary Question**
"Submit your bid for this task."

**Why This Question Exists**
For task-based engagement opportunities (`subModelType === 'task_based'`), applicants must provide a specific bid amount, proposed duration, and approach description. This enables competitive evaluation.

**User Inputs**

| Field              | Type     | Required | Notes                              |
|--------------------|----------|----------|------------------------------------|
| task-bid-amount    | number   | Yes      | Bid amount in SAR, min: 0          |
| task-bid-duration  | number   | No       | Proposed duration in days, min: 1  |
| task-bid-comments  | textarea | Yes      | Description of approach/methodology|

**Displayed Information**
- Task title (from opportunity attributes)
- Task scope (from opportunity attributes)
- Budget range (from opportunity exchange data)

**Conditional Logic**
- This entire step is **skipped** if the opportunity's sub-model is NOT `task_based`.
- When skipped, the wizard advances directly from Step 4 to Step 6.
- The step indicator for Step 5 is hidden when the step is skipped.
- When Step 5 is hidden, the Review step (Step 6) is renumbered to display as "Step 5" in the UI.

**Validation Rules**
- `task-bid-amount` -- Required. Error: "Please provide a bid amount".
- `task-bid-comments` -- Required. Error: "Please provide comments about your approach".

**System Actions**
- Store bid data (`taskBidAmount`, `taskBidDuration`, `taskBidComments`) in application responses.
- Navigate to Step 6.

---

### Step 6 -- Review and Submit

**Primary Question**
"Review your application before submitting."

**Why This Question Exists**
A final review step allows the applicant to verify their proposal, responses, payment preference, and bid before submission.

**User Inputs**
None (read-only review).

**Displayed Sections**
1. **Proposal** -- Full text of the proposal.
2. **Detailed Responses** (if Step 3 was active) -- Each response with its label and value.
3. **Payment Preference** -- Selected preference label and any comments.
4. **Task Bidding** (if Step 5 was active) -- Bid amount, duration, and approach.

**Conditional Logic**
- Detailed Responses section hidden if Step 3 was skipped.
- Task Bidding section hidden if Step 5 was skipped.

**Validation Rules**
None on the review step itself.

**System Actions -- New Application**
1. Collect all data: proposal, detailed responses, payment preference, task bids.
2. Create application via `dataService.createApplication()`:
   ```
   {
     opportunityId: string,
     applicantId:   string,
     proposal:      string,
     responses: {
       response_{key}: string,   // per model attribute
       paymentPreference: string,
       paymentComments:   string,
       taskBidAmount:     number, // if task-based
       taskBidDuration:   number, // if task-based
       taskBidComments:   string  // if task-based
     }
   }
   ```
3. Default status: `pending`.
4. If this is the first application for the opportunity AND the opportunity status is `published`: update opportunity status to `in_negotiation`.
5. Send notification to opportunity creator:
   - `type`: `application_received`
   - `title`: "New Application"
   - `message`: "You received a new application for '[opportunity title]'"
6. Reload the page to reflect the updated state.

**System Actions -- Edit Application (Update)**
1. Update existing application via `dataService.updateApplication()`.
2. Merge new responses with existing responses.
3. Send notification to opportunity creator:
   - `type`: `application_updated`
   - `title`: "Application Updated"
   - `message`: "[applicant email] updated their application for '[opportunity title]'"
4. Reload the page.

## Application Management (Owner View)

### Applications List

When the opportunity owner views the detail page, an "Applications" section is shown with the count of applications and a list of application cards.

Each application card displays:
- Applicant name or email
- Application status badge
- Proposal text (truncated)
- Application date
- Action buttons: Accept, Reject

### Accept Application

**System Actions:**
1. Update application status to `accepted`.
2. Create a contract record automatically:
   ```
   {
     opportunityId:  string,
     applicationId:  string,
     creatorId:      string (opportunity creator),
     contractorId:   string (applicant),
     scope:          string (opportunity title),
     paymentMode:    string (opportunity exchange mode),
     duration:       string,
     status:         "pending"
   }
   ```
3. Update opportunity status to `contracted`.
4. Send notification to applicant:
   - `type`: `application_status_changed`
   - `title`: "Application Status Updated"
   - `message`: "Your application for '[opportunity title]' has been accepted"
5. Reload applications list.

### Reject Application

**System Actions:**
1. Update application status to `rejected`.
2. Send notification to applicant:
   - `type`: `application_status_changed`
   - `title`: "Application Status Updated"
   - `message`: "Your application for '[opportunity title]' has been rejected"
3. Reload applications list.

## Matching Algorithm

The matching algorithm calculates a compatibility score (0.0 to 1.0) between an opportunity and a candidate. It runs automatically when an opportunity is published.

### Scoring Breakdown

| Criteria                    | Max Points | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------------------|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Skills Match                | 50         | Compares opportunity `requiredSkills`/`offeredSkills` against candidate `specializations`, `skills`, `classifications`. Score = (matched / total) * 50. |
| Sectors Match               | 15         | Checks if any opportunity `sectors` match candidate `sectors` or `industry`. Binary: 15 or 0. |
| Certifications Match        | 15         | Compares opportunity `certifications` against candidate `certifications`. Score = (matched / total) * 15. |
| Payment Compatibility       | 10         | Checks if opportunity `paymentModes` / `exchangeMode` matches candidate `preferredPaymentModes`. Match = 10, no prefs = 5, mismatch = 0. |
| Model-Specific Matching     | 100        | Varies by model type (see below).                                           |
| Past Performance            | 20         | Based on candidate's acceptance rate from past applications. New users get default 10 points. Score = acceptanceRate * 20. |

**Total possible points vary** depending on which criteria are present. Final score = totalScore / maxScore.

### Model-Specific Matching

**Task-Based Engagement (task_based):**
- Skill match: 40 points
- Experience match: 20 points (compares experience level to years)
- Budget compatibility: 20 points
- Location compatibility: 10 points
- Availability match: 10 points

**Consortium / Project JV:**
- Scope match (roles): 30 points
- Financial capacity: 30 points (candidate needs >= 10% of project value)
- Experience match: 20 points
- Geographic proximity: 20 points

**SPV:**
- Financial capacity: 50 points (50M SAR minimum)
- Sector expertise: 30 points
- Project experience: 20 points (10+ years for full score)

**Strategic Partnership:**

- Timeline alignment: 20 points
- Geographic proximity: 10 points

**Hiring:**
- Qualification match: 30 points
- Experience match: 30 points
- Skill match: 30 points
- Location compatibility: 10 points

**Competition:**
- Eligibility criteria: 60 points
- Experience match: 40 points

### Thresholds

| Threshold             | Value | Behavior                                               |
|-----------------------|-------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| MIN_THRESHOLD         | 0.70  | Minimum 70% score to be considered a match             |
| AUTO_NOTIFY_THRESHOLD | 0.80  | Candidates with >= 80% score are automatically notified|

### Auto-Notification

When a match score >= 80%, the system automatically:
1. Creates a notification for the candidate:
   - `type`: `match_found`
   - `title`: "New Match Found"
   - `message`: "You have a [X]% match for '[opportunity title]'"
2. Updates the match record as `notified: true`.

## Pipeline / Kanban View

Applications can be viewed in a kanban board layout at `/pipeline`, organized into columns by status:

| Column       | Status          |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Pending      | `pending`       |
| Reviewing    | `reviewing`     |
| Shortlisted  | `shortlisted`   |
| Accepted     | `accepted`      |
| Rejected     | `rejected`      |

The pipeline view includes tabs for Opportunities, Applications, and Matches.
