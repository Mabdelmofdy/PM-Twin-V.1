# Registration

## Overview

The Registration module handles the onboarding of new users and companies onto the PMTwin platform. It supports two distinct registration paths -- Company/Entity and Individual (Professional or Consultant) -- each implemented as a multi-step wizard. The module collects identity information, verifies email and mobile via OTP, collects role-specific documents, and submits the account for admin approval. Post-registration, the Admin Vetting sub-flow handles approval, rejection, or clarification requests.

## Actors

| Actor   | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| User    | A new visitor registering as a Company/Entity or as an Individual (Professional or Consultant). |
| System  | Creates the account record, sends OTP codes, validates inputs, creates audit logs, and manages status transitions. |
| Admin   | Reviews pending registrations via the Admin Vetting interface. Can approve, reject, or request clarification. |

## Step-by-Step Flow

### Step 0 -- Account Type Selection

**Primary Question**
"How would you like to register?"

**Why This Question Exists**
PMTwin serves two fundamentally different user types -- organizations and individuals -- each with different data requirements, document needs, and role structures. The selection determines the entire subsequent registration path.

**User Inputs**

| Field       | Type  | Required | Values                               |
|-------------|-------|----------|--------------------------------------|
| accountType | radio | Yes      | `company` (Company/Entity), `individual` (Individual) |

**Dropdown Values**
N/A -- radio buttons with static values.

**Conditional Logic**
- Selecting `company` routes the user to Steps A1 through A4.
- Selecting `individual` routes the user to Steps B1 through B4.
- The "Continue" button is disabled until a selection is made.

**Validation Rules**
- One option must be selected before proceeding.

**System Actions**
- Set `regState.accountType` to the selected value.
- Show the wizard progress bar (hidden on Step 0).
- Navigate to Step A1 or B1 depending on selection.

## Company Registration Path (Steps A1 -- A4)

### Step A1 -- Company Role Selection

**Primary Question**
"What is your company's role in the construction ecosystem?"

**Why This Question Exists**
The company role determines the sub-type options, the required verification documents, and future matching criteria. Different roles have different regulatory and documentation requirements.

**User Inputs**

| Field              | Type   | Required                        | Source                            |
|--------------------|--------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| reg-company-role   | select | Yes                             | `lookups.json > companyRoles`     |
| reg-company-subtype| select | Yes (if role has sub-types)     | `lookups.json > companyRoleSubTypes[role]` |

**Dropdown Values**

Company Roles (`companyRoles`):

| ID                      | Label                    | Has Sub-Types |
|-------------------------|--------------------------|---------------|
| `beneficiary`           | Beneficiary              | No            |
| `vendor`                | Vendor                   | Yes           |
| `skill_service_provider`| Skill Service Provider   | No            |
| `sub_contractor`        | Sub-Contractor           | Yes           |
| `consultant_company`    | Consultant (company)     | No            |

Company Role Sub-Types (`companyRoleSubTypes`):

For `vendor`:

| ID          | Label      |
|-------------|------------|
| `supplies`  | Supplies   |
| `equipment` | Equipment  |
| `materials` | Materials  |

For `sub_contractor`:

| ID               | Label           |
|------------------|-----------------|
| `specialty_trade`| Specialty Trade |
| `labor`          | Labor           |
| `technical`      | Technical       |

**Conditional Logic**
- The sub-type dropdown is hidden by default.
- When a role with `hasSubTypes: true` is selected (`vendor` or `sub_contractor`), the sub-type dropdown is shown and populated with the corresponding options.
- When a role without sub-types is selected, the sub-type dropdown is hidden and its value is cleared.

**Validation Rules**
- `reg-company-role` -- Required. Must select a value.
- `reg-company-subtype` -- Required only if the sub-type dropdown is visible (role has sub-types).

**System Actions**
- Store selected role in `regState.companyRole`.
- Store selected sub-type in `regState.companySubType` (or `null`).
- Trigger document list rendering for Step A3 based on the selected role.
- Navigate to Step A2.

### Step A2 -- Company Details and Verification

**Primary Question**
"Tell us about your company and verify your contact information."

**Why This Question Exists**
The platform needs company identity details for profile creation, search/matching, and compliance. Email and mobile verification via OTP ensures the contact information is authentic.

**User Inputs**

| Field                | Type     | Required | Notes                            |
|----------------------|----------|----------|----------------------------------|
| reg-company-name     | text     | Yes      |                                  |
| reg-company-website  | url      | No       |                                  |
| reg-email            | email    | Yes      | Must be verified via OTP         |
| reg-mobile           | tel      | Yes      | Must be verified via OTP         |
| reg-address-country  | select   | Yes      | Source: `locations.json > countries` |
| reg-address-region   | select   | No       | Cascading: populated based on country |
| reg-address-city     | select   | No       | Cascading: populated based on region |
| reg-password         | password | Yes      | Minimum 6 characters             |
| reg-confirm-password | password | Yes      | Must match reg-password          |

**Dropdown Values**

Location data is loaded from `locations.json`:
- Countries: Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Remote
- Regions: Populated dynamically based on selected country (e.g., Saudi Arabia has 13 regions: Riyadh, Makkah, Eastern Province, Qassim, Tabuk, Asir, Hail, Northern Borders, Jazan, Najran, Al Bahah, Al Jouf, Madinah)
- Cities: Populated dynamically based on selected region (e.g., Riyadh region has Riyadh City, Kharj, Dawadmi, Wadi ad-Dawasir)

**OTP Verification Flow**

For both email and mobile:
1. User enters their email/mobile number.
2. User clicks "Send OTP".
3. System generates a 6-digit OTP code: `Math.floor(100000 + Math.random() * 900000)`.
4. In the POC, the code is displayed on-screen (production would send via email/SMS).
5. User enters the code in the verification input field.
6. User clicks "Verify".
7. System compares the entered code with the stored code.
8. On match: A green "Verified" badge is shown; `regState.emailVerified` or `regState.mobileVerified` is set to `true`.
9. On mismatch: Error message "Invalid code" is shown.

**Conditional Logic**
- Region dropdown is empty until a country is selected.
- City dropdown is empty until a region is selected.

**Validation Rules**
- `reg-company-name` -- Required. Non-empty after trim.
- `reg-email` -- Required. Must be verified via OTP (`regState.emailVerified === true`).
- `reg-mobile` -- Required. Must be verified via OTP (`regState.mobileVerified === true`).
- `reg-address-country` -- Required.
- `reg-password` -- Required. Minimum 6 characters.
- `reg-confirm-password` -- Required. Must exactly match `reg-password`.

**System Actions**
- Store all field values in `regState`.
- OTP codes stored in-memory in `otpCodes` object (separate keys for company email/mobile).
- On successful step validation, navigate to Step A3.

### Step A3 -- Documents and Terms

**Primary Question**
"Upload your company's verification documents and accept the terms."

**Why This Question Exists**
Document verification is essential for compliance and trust. Different company roles require different documents. The Terms and Conditions acceptance creates a legal agreement.

**User Inputs**

| Field               | Type     | Required | Notes                                    |
|---------------------|----------|----------|------------------------------------------|

**Consultant (company):**

| Document ID       | Label                       | Required |
|-------------------|-----------------------------|----------|
| `cr`              | Commercial Registration (CR) | Yes      |
| `vat`             | VAT Certificate              | Yes      |
| `company_profile` | Company Profile              | Yes      |

## Individual Registration Path (Steps B1 -- B4)

### Step B1 -- Individual Type Selection

**Primary Question**
"Are you a Professional or a Consultant?"

**Why This Question Exists**
Professionals and consultants have different document requirements, profile fields, and matching criteria. This distinction also determines the user's role in the system.

**User Inputs**

| Field          | Type  | Required | Values                                    |

**Dropdown Values**
N/A -- radio buttons.

**Conditional Logic**
- Selecting `professional` will show the "Discipline / Specialty" field and render professional-specific documents in Step B3.
- Selecting `consultant` will show the "Expertise Area" field and render consultant-specific documents in Step B3.

**Validation Rules**
- One option must be selected. Error: "Please select Professional or Consultant".

**System Actions**
- Store selection in `regState.individualType`.
- Toggle visibility of specialty/expertise fields for Step B2.
- Render individual-type-specific documents for Step B3.
- Navigate to Step B2.

---

### Step B2 -- Personal Details and Verification

**Primary Question**
"Tell us about yourself and verify your contact information."

**Why This Question Exists**

| reg-ind-confirm-password | password | Yes                          | Must match reg-ind-password             |
| reg-specialty            | text     | Yes (if Professional)        | Shown only for Professional type        |
| reg-expertise            | text     | Yes (if Consultant)          | Shown only for Consultant type          |

**Dropdown Values**
Same cascading location dropdowns as Company Step A2 (countries, regions, cities from `locations.json`).

**OTP Verification Flow**
Same flow as Company Step A2, but uses separate OTP code keys (`indEmail`, `indMobile`) to avoid conflicts.

**Conditional Logic**
- `reg-specialty` (Discipline / Specialty) is shown only when `individualType === 'professional'`.
- `reg-expertise` (Expertise Area) is shown only when `individualType === 'consultant'`.

**Validation Rules**
- `reg-full-name` -- Required. Non-empty after trim.

1. Update user/company status to `active`.
2. Send notification to user:
   - `type`: `account_approved`
   - `title`: "Account Approved"
   - `message`: "Your account has been approved. You can now access all features."
3. Create audit log:
   - `action`: `user_approved` or `company_approved`

   - `type`: `account_rejected`
   - `title`: "Account Rejected"
   - `message`: "Your account was rejected: [reason]" (or generic message if no reason).
4. Create audit log:
   - `action`: `user_rejected` or `company_rejected`
   - `details`: `{ reason }`

### Action: Request Clarification

**System Actions:**
1. Admin prompted for reason/missing items (optional).
2. Update user/company status to `clarification_requested`.
3. Send notification to user:
   - `type`: `account_clarification_requested`
   - `title`: "Registration needs clarification"
   - `message`: "Your registration needs clarification: [reason]. Please update your profile or documents and submit for review again."
4. Create audit log:
   - `action`: `user_clarification_requested` or `company_clarification_requested`
   - `details`: `{ reason }`

### Clarification Resubmission
- Users with `clarification_requested` status can log in (authentication module allows this status).
- On their profile page, a banner is displayed informing them that clarification is needed.
- A "Submit for review again" button is available.
- On resubmission, the status is changed back to `pending` for admin review.
